# RESTful Go API
This repo holds the code content for the RESTful GO API live trainging session.

This content will continue to grow as I learn more and get your feedback.

If any section is not 100% clear open an issue. If you see anything that you can fix, create a PR.

## Structure
In order to gradually build up the conent for optimal learning, I have decided to make use of git branches. Each branch name will have the format `<Topic>-01..n`.

Each topic will be in their own folder and will be a complete go project.

At each level of the workshop the branch should be working code. If it is not I will mention it.
